                Ever since I was a little kid I have been fascinated with
                technology and the various ways it can impact our lives. From my
                earliest years, I saw what my parents were doing with tech and
                wanted to be just like them. My parents were , tech-heads per se
                , but I have unabashedly been a tech enthusiast for my entire
                life

                past, where my relationship with tech is currently, and why I
                have developed this passion for consumer technology . For now,
                let’s start with my early days with technology .

          <h3>Why CSS is <b>Important </b></h3>

                CSS is important because it controls all design-related aspects
                of your website. Typography, colours, page layouts and any other
                visual aspects of your website are all controlled by CSS.

          <p>
            <b>
              <i>
                CSS separates a page's content and structure from it's design
                and formatting. This allows designers and website owners to
                quickly apply formatting to their layouts, and make any
                necessary changes and tweaks.

              <i>
                What's more, CSS allows you to control and adjust the design and
                formatting of your entire website (no matter how big or small it
                is) from a single spot. This is done using what's called an
                external style sheet.

          <h3>Difference between padding, margin and borders</h3>
          <p>
            <b>
              <i>
                padding is the space between an element’s border and the
                element’s content. The padding property controls the space
                inside an element ,padding is located inside the border of an
                element.

              <i>
                margins determine the space surrounding an element, margin is
                the space around an element’s border.The margin property
                controls the space outside an element,

              <i>
                The border is the layer of the CSS box model that sits between
                margin and padding. By default, the border does not have any
                width, but you can set one with the CSS border property
